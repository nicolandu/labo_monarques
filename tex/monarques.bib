  abstract = {Prior to 2014, the milkweed (Asclepias spp.) was listed as a noxious weed, contributing to its population's decline in Canada. Considering its importance for the lifecycle of the threatened monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), it has been de-listed, and efforts are in place to re-establish the populations. Seed propagation may assist in increasing the population, but germination is difficult. The objectives of this study were to (1) test the efficacy of three different germination protocols: cold stratification, mechanical scarification, and chemical treatment of ascorbic acid and (2) determine whether environmental conditions could potentially influence germination. Independent experiments were conducted in Petri dishes and in soil, from seeds collected from three sites. In both experiments, mechanical scarification was the most effective pre-germination treatment, followed by cold stratification (4~°C). Germination rates differed among sites with site 3 having the largest germination rate. The tallest seedlings with the largest number of leaves (height mean~=~5.95, p~{$<~$}0.05) were from site 2. Variability might be the result of maternal and environmental effects as plants were exposed to different light intensity and disturbance intensity. Future research should consider conducting genetic analysis on the influence of maternal environmental effects on seed germinability to improve propagation.},

  abstract = {As temperatures warm in response to anthropogenic changes (climate change and urbanization), animals must respond adaptively to these changes or be displaced. Here, we use community science data (iNaturalist and BugGuide) to show that melanization in larval monarch butterflies ( Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus, 1758), an endangered species in Canada) is correlated with latitude and temperature across a latitudinal gradient, indicating likely use in thermoregulation. We also predicted that melanization would decrease in cities where temperatures are consistently higher than rural areas; however, we found that while melanization was lower in urban areas, it was not statistically significant. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering life stage when assessing capacity for adaptation to anthropogenic change in vulnerable animal populations, like monarch butterflies. We also show the value of using community science to sample species (particular those of most concern) distributions across the landscape.},

  abstract = {Monarch butterfly (               Danaus plexippus               ) decline over the past 25 years has received considerable public and scientific attention, in large part because its decline, and that of its milkweed (               Asclepias               spp.) host plant, have been linked to genetically modified (GM) crops and associated herbicide use. Here, we use museum and herbaria specimens to extend our knowledge of the dynamics of both monarchs and milkweeds in the United States to more than a century, from 1900 to 2016. We show that both monarchs and milkweeds increased during the early 20th century and that recent declines are actually part of a much longer-term decline in both monarchs and milkweed beginning around 1950. Herbicide-resistant crops, therefore, are clearly not the only culprit and, likely, not even the primary culprit: Not only did monarch and milkweed declines begin decades before GM crops were introduced, but other variables, particularly a decline in the number of farms, predict common milkweed trends more strongly over the period studied here.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Danaus plexippus               L. (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is well-known and captivating migratory insect that cannot overwinter in temperate climates. Although common throughout North America, monarch butterfly populations appear to be declining widely in their geographically distinct areas. Rapid climatic change is posing a serious threat to monarch butterfly populations, especially the migratory groups in the east. This study assesses how several climate change scenarios will affect the global distribution of monarch butterflies. Using climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model, we conducted projections for the near future (2021–2040) and far future (2041–2060, 2081–2100) under high (SSP5\_8.5) and low (SSP1\_2.6) emission scenarios. We estimated habitat gain, loss, and stability for               D. plexippus               . True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to assess the model’s performance. The results indicated that annual precipitation, land cover, and altitude (Alt) were the most influential factors affecting               D. plexippus               distribution. Potential habitat shifts were observed in Central Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, with both gains and losses. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between the climatic factors and distribution of migratory insects, emphasizing the need for targeted conservation efforts to mitigate climate change impacts on               D. plexippus               populations. Management strategies should prioritize habitat restoration, focus on overwintering site preservation, and implement adaptive management approaches. This research provides an evidence base for adaptive management to minimize climate change impacts on migratory insect populations.},

  abstract = {Overwintering populations of the monarch butterfly,               Danaus plexippus               , have been in decline for the past 30 years. Several hypotheses for the decline have been proposed, including summer and winter habitat loss and migration mortality due to non-senescing milkweeds and the parasite               Ophryocystis elektroscirrha               (OE). However, the impact of climate change on migrant physiology, has been understudied. This is surprising because warmer temperatures will probably destabilize reproductive diapause, a physiological strategy central to migration and overwintering success. Here, we exposed wild-caught migrants to different field-realistic migratory temperatures under laboratory conditions for 30 days, followed by different overwintering temperatures until death. During the migratory phase, warmer temperatures reduced male body condition, increased male mortality, increased mating frequency and caused females to prematurely abandon their reproductive diapause/dormancy and invest in oocyte production in the absence of milkweed. Monarchs that experienced warm migratory conditions prior to overwintering also exhibited greater overwintering reproductive development and mortality. Overall, reproductive development and OE burden were the best predictors of death. These data suggest warm migratory temperatures significantly alter monarch physiology and fitness and provide a mechanism by which climate change could facilitate migratory failure, winter-breeding and overwintering mortality, all of which can decrease overwintering population size.},
